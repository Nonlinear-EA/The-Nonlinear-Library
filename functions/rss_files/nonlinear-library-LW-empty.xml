    This is: ask me about my battery, published by bhauth on April 21, 2023 on LessWrong. <br /><br /><p>Some years ago, I designed a battery chemistry. Then, I got a semi-related chemical industry job. Then, in 2020, I did some testing at a university lab. Here's the basic design:</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Xn8EjGzndLbAsadW2/q3gz4t2qjmgdkucxtwho" /></figure><p>As far as I was able to test it, the battery design worked, but the project died. I haven't been able to do much with that design since.</p><p>The current name for this battery chemistry is "SMAC" for "sodium metal aqueous cathode". If you want, you can ask about:</p><ul><li>technical details</li><li>experimental results</li><li>why I didn't do X</li><li>the response from X types of people</li><li>other battery chemistries</li></ul><p>I could certainly provide more details here, but I'm curious what people are most interested in.</p> <p>Thanks for listening.
